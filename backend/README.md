🧭 Travel Package Recommendation System
📌 Overview

The Travel Package Recommendation System is an intelligent web application built using Streamlit and Machine Learning (KNN with Cosine Similarity).
It recommends personalized travel packages based on user preferences such as departure city, destination, destination type, trip duration, and budget.

The app analyzes a large dataset of real-world travel packages and finds the most relevant and similar trips that match the user’s interests, offering an intuitive way to explore and plan travel experiences.

🚀 Features

✅ Interactive UI – Built with Streamlit for a simple, user-friendly interface.
✅ Smart Recommendations – Uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with cosine similarity to find the most relevant travel packages.
✅ Data Preprocessing – Utilizes OneHotEncoder for categorical encoding and MinMaxScaler for numerical normalization.
✅ Dynamic Filtering – Destination and type dropdowns update automatically based on the selected departure city.
✅ Similarity Score Display – Shows how close each recommendation is to the user’s preferences.
✅ Scalable Design – Efficiently handles dataset without performance issues.

🧠 How It Works

1️⃣ User Inputs Preferences:

Departure City

Destination

Destination Type

Trip Duration

Budget

2️⃣ Feature Engineering:

Categorical data → Encoded using OneHotEncoder

Numerical data → Normalized using MinMaxScaler

3️⃣ Model Training:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model trained using all travel packages.

Uses Cosine Similarity metric to identify top 5 most similar packages.

4️⃣ Recommendations Display:

Displays the top 5 recommended trips along with similarity scores in a Streamlit DataFrame.

Each recommendation includes details like destination, duration, transport, and package type.

🛠️ Future Enhancements

🚗 Integrate Google Maps API to show trip locations visually.

⭐ Add user reviews and ratings for each package.

🧮 Implement Deep Learning–based recommendations (e.g., neural collaborative filtering).

🎯 Introduce advanced filters — by season, activity type, or budget range.

📊 Add data visualization dashboards for user insights.
